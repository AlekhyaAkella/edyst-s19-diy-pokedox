This Repo is about working of dynamic APIs.
An API was built using Flask framework.It consists of one rote /api/pokemon/:id' where id ranges from 1 to 151.
If user enter an id ranging from 1 to 151 ,it gives the details about that particular pokemon details.
If user either enters an id other than that range or enters any other route an error code is generated.
