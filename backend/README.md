This Repo is about working of dynamic APIs.

An API was built using "Flask" framework.It consists of one route '/api/pokemon/:id' where id ranges from 1 to 151.

If user enters an id ranging from 1 to 151 ,it gives the details about that particular pokemon details.

If user either enters an id other than that range or enters any other route an error code is generated.

How to Run the project:

open the browser and enter url as:"localhost:8006/api/pokemon/:id"
